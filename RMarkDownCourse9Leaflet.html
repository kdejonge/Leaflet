## R Markdown

For the 9th course of the Data Science Specialization you need to create a  web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. For this purpose I will create a simple map with multiple markers. I think, as a geographer, that it is better to make your maps in ArcGIS :)


```{r Map, echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
set.seed(2018-11-18)
df <- data.frame(lat = runif(20, min=39.2, max=39.3), lng = runif(20, min=-76.6, max=-76.5))
df %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers() 

```
